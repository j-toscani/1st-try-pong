# My first Game

This is supposed to be a single player pongesque Game to try out canvas. I will start with simple drawings and colision tests. The final Version should include:



## Milestones

- [x] Draw the Canvas that refreshes itself
- [x] Create a moving Ball that bounces off Walls
- [x] Create a Pedal on the bottom of the screen the ball bounces off of.
- [x] Make the Paddle moveable and keep bounce-property
- [x] Create an End and a Start for the game by implementing lives and a Game-Over alert.
- [x] To make it increasingly difficult, adjust the speed of the ball everytime it bounces off the paddle
- [x] Convert collision-tests into functions to improve readebillity and reduce typing
- [X] Create two new levels with obstacles to further explore collision tests
- [ ] Create four different zones on the pedal so that the ball takes a new path after hitting the pedal
- [ ] Create a welcome Page where you can choose between game-options, enter your Name etc.
- [ ] Think about wheter or not this game is suited for mobile and do your best to realise a responsive design
- [ ] create and visualise different moving objects that have to be hit by the player

This project was converted to React and further explored in another Repo! Take a look here: https://github.com/j-toscani/king-pong
