# My first Game

This is supposed to be a single player pongesque Game to try out canvas. I will start with simple drawings and colision tests. The final Version should include:

1. Levels
1. Enemies
1. Bosses
1. Highscore(Leaderboards)
1. Procedurally generated Levels

## Milestones

- [x] Draw the Canvas that refreshes itself
- [x] Create a moving Ball that bounces off Walls
- [x] Create a Pedal on the bottom of the screen the ball bounces off of.
- [x] Make the Paddle moveable and keep bounce-property
- [x] Create an End and a Start for the game by implementing lives and a Game-Over alert.
- [x] To make it increasingly difficult, adjust the speed of the ball everytime it bounces off the paddle
- [x] create and visualise different objects that have to be hit by the player
- [ ] rethink colision-detection and ask for review
- [ ] Create a backround
- [ ] Take a look at what you made and be proud of yourself!
- [ ] Create four different zones on the pedal so that the ball takes a new path after hitting the pedal
- [ ] Create a welcome Page where you can choose between game-options, enter your Name and stuff
- [ ] think about wheter or not this game is suited for mobile and do your best to realise a responsive design
